###Test/Demo ISLE - Installation Guide
_Expectations:  It takes an average of **15-45 minutes** to read this entire document and perform the installation as prescribed._

Follow this guide to spin up and install ISLE utilizing the built-in `isle.localdomain` domain name for review and testing.

This Test/Demo ISLE guide creates an Islandora environment (`isle.localdomain`) that includes an un-themed Drupal website and empty Fedora repository for endusers to develop code, test ingests, test metadata, update fields in SOLR indexing and otherwise "kick the tires" on ISLE prior for further usages e.g. creating a new ISLE production site or migrating a current Islandora production site to ISLE.

This checklist will attempt to point out most of the usage challenges or pitfalls.  For additional help, please post a message to the [Islandora ISLE Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora-isle).

**Please note:** There is a [Glossary](../glossary.md) with relevant terms to help guide installation.

### Assumptions / Prerequisites

* This test site guide is designed for a local laptop / workstation that has already followed the appropriate setup and configuration instructions in the `Test/Demo ISLE` section of the [guide](../index.md#test-demo-isle).

* Instructions below assume a MacOS or Linux laptop or workstation. Windows users may have to adjust / swap out various tools as needed.

---

### Process overview

* Edit /etc/hosts on local laptop or desktop to allow user to easily connect to ISLE test system
* Test site launch process
* Run install script on Apache container
* Test the site
* Sample object ingestion
* Troubleshooting

### Step 0: edit /etc/hosts on local laptop or desktop

It is important to add `isle.localdomain admin.isle.localdomian portainer.isle.localdomain` to your `/etc/hosts` file, as connecting directly to an IP address can prevent some components from working properly.

* Instructions for editing hosts files can be found [here](../07_appendices/editing-the-hosts-file.md).  

* After completing the appropriate steps, please return to this guide and continue with _Step 1: Test site Launch process_ below.

---

### Step 1: Test site launch process

* In terminal (shell) or PowerShell navigate to your ISLE project directory. You may already be in this directory if you are coming from the [Software Requirements Guide](../01_installation_host_server/software-dependencies.md).

The following steps below are for all users (_Vagrant, VM, non Vagrant and Docker for MacOS, Windows and Ubuntu Desktop users alike._)

The install times stated below for each container are highly dependent on the enduser's available Internet bandwidth and could take more or less time accordingly.

* Within the open terminal, run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

* This is going to download and start all ISLE Docker images (_roughly 6 GB of data so it may take a little while depending on your Internet connection_)

* To check if the containers are running: `docker ps` (shows only running containers)

    * If you don't see all containers try: `docker ps -a` (shows all containers running or not)

**If all containers are NOT running, then proceed to the Troubleshooting section first before advancing to the "Install script on Apache container" section below**


-----

### Step 2: Run install script on Apache container

**Total build process** may take up to 15 - 45 minutes (_depending on system and internet speeds_)

* Run the following install site script on the apache container by copying and pasting this command:
```bash
docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh`
```

_For Windows Users only_

* You may be prompted by Windows to:
    * Share the C drive with Docker.  Click okay or allow
        * Enter your username and password
        * Allow vpnkit.exe to communicate with the network.  Click Okay or Allow to accept the default selection.
        * If the process seems to halt, check the taskbar for background windows.


    * **This script will take some time (see estimate above.)** You should see a lot of green [ok] messages.
    * If the script appears to pause and prompt for y/n, do not enter any values; the script will answer for you.  
    * Wait until "Drush script finished! ...exiting" before proceeding.**

### Step 4: Testing the site

* Test (QC) the resulting setup by opening a web browser to the `isle.localdomain` URL of the new ISLE sample site (i.e. [https://isle.localdomain](https://isle.localdomain)) and logging in.

* Upon entering [https://isle.localdomain](https://isle.localdomain) within a browser, you will see a SSL error warning that the site is unsafe. It is safe, it simply uses "self-signed" SSL certs. Ignore the error and proceed to the site.

* To log in to the Islandora Drupal Site:
    * Username: `isle`
    * Password: `isle`

* There is additional information for users and passwords that can be found on the [Test Site Resources](ild_resources.md) page.

### Step 5: Sample objects for ingest

Courtesy of the [Islandora Collaboration Group](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/icg_information) there is a sample set of objects and corresponding metadata that can be used for ingest.

More information can be found on the [Test Site Resources](ild_resources.md) page.

### Post Ingest Search Tip
After ingesting content, you will need to add an Islandora Simple Search block to the Drupal structure.  The default search box that appears on install will only search Drupal content, not Islandora content.

* Structure Menu > Blocks
* Scroll down to find "Islandora Simple Search".  Use dropdown to set to Sidebar Second.
* Save Blocks on the bottom of the page

This process will now allow you to search for ingested objects that have been indexed by SOLR.

---

### Note

* The Proxy Control Panel is available at [admin.isle.localdomain](https://admin.isle.localdomain).  No username/password are required.  This is unsafe for production environments.

* Portainer (a Docker control panel) is available at [portainer.isle.localdomain](http://portainer.isle.localdomain). No username/password are required.  This is unsafe for production environments.

### WARNING

* Please always use the [https://isle.localdomain](https://isle.localdomain) domain to view the site, login etc

* Do not use an IP e.g. `https://10.10.10.130 or https://127.0.0.01` to view the Drupal site, login etc as some components won't work e.g. Large Images using the OpenSeadragon Viewer.

### Troubleshooting

#### Port Conflicts
If you encounter an error like this:

`Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:xxxx failed: port is already allocated`

then ISLE may have encountered a conflict with the `xxxx` port identified in the error message.

In MacOS, this can frequently be caused by a local Apache or Nginx web server, or local MySQL server.  

You may need to remove or disable these local web servers before you can successfully install ISLE.

* If you have a local Apache web server that ships with most MacOS machines may conflict with port 80, and can usually be disabled from a terminal using these commands:

    * `sudo apachectl stop`
    * `sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist 2>/dev/null`

* If you have a local `Nginx` web server it may conflict with port 8080, and it can usually be disabled from a terminal using:

    * `sudo nginx -s stop`

Once your web server(s) have been disabled, resume the ISLE install process by repeating your last installation command, presumably `docker-compose up -d`.

#### Non-running Containers
If you don't see all containers running, then stop the running containers with `docker-compose down -d` and start the containers one at a time following the instructions below:

*  MySQL image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:1.1`

    `docker-compose up -d mysql`

*  Fedora image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:1.1`

    `docker-compose up -d fedora`

    (Optional but recommended troubleshooting step)

    * Please note the Tomcat service requires about  one to three minutes to startup and as such if the enduser rushes to the URL supplied below, the service page maytime out or be reported as unreachable. Give it a little time.
    * After spinning up fedora container, check if the Fedora service is running prior to advancing.
    * Navigate to http://hostip:8081/manager/html a popup login prompt should appear.
    * Enter the user name of `admin` and the password of `isle_admin`
    * Upon login a large display of running Tomcat applications should display, scroll down to fedora
    * The application state / status should be true
    * If false appears instead, attempt to restart the fedora service manually.
    * Select the restart button to the right of the status area.
    * If it still fails, review the mounted fedora logs. The docker-compose.yml file will indicate where the logs are located.
    * Using terminal and then entering a command like `tail -n 300 - <path to ISLE project/data/fedora/log/tomcat:/usr/local/tomcat/logs/fedora.log` should display enough information to troubleshoot or restart the entire startup process.

* Solr image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:1.1`

    `docker-compose up -d solr`

* Apache image pull & container launch

    `docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:1.1`

    `docker-compose up -d apache`
