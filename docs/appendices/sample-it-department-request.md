###Sample IT Department Request Letter

Dear IT Dept,

Our digital collections team will be testing a Docker implementation of the Islandora digital repository system called [ISLE](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/).

We require access to a server meeting the following [Hardware Requirements](../install/host-hardware-requirements.md):

 * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or CentOS 7.x running on a server or virtual machine
 * Minimum 2 CPU's (w/1-4 cores each)
 * Sufficient hard drive or attached storage to hold your collection
 * 30 - 50GB for the server OS and overhead
 * 16 - 32 GB of RAM

Our team will either need root access, or a user called "islandora" that has sudo privileges.

We will need the above hardware so that the automated ISLE installation process can install the following [Software Dependencies](../install/host-software-dependencies.md):

 * Git, Docker, Docker-Compose, openssl, git, htop, ntp, curl

Thank you,
