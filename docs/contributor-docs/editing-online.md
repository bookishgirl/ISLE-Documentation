## Overview
* Navigate to online ISLE-Documentation repository
* Edit existing pages
* Adding new pages
    * Updating `mkdocs.yml`
* Commit changes using a new branch
* Create pull request for review

**Please note:** You'll need to create separate pull requests for each type of change whether editing or adding new pages with a `mkdocs.yml` file update. Using the online editor means you can only do one thing at a time.

If you need to edit more than one file or want to create more than one new page of content, it is recommended to instead follow the steps contained within the [Documentation Editing - Local](../contributor-docs/editing-local.md) Guide.

### Navigate to Online ISLE-Documentation Repository
* In a web browser navigate to [https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE-Documentation](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE-Documentation)

---

### Edit Existing Pages

* Click into the `docs` directory and navigate to the appropriate `.md` file you would like to edit.

* Once the file has been selected, you should see on the right hand side of the page, a navigation bar that will display `Raw | Blame | History`, computer monitor icon, a pen / pencil icon and a trashcan icon. Click the pen / pencil icon to edit the file.

* The page should change indicating that it can now be edited.

* Make the appropriate edits as needed.

* When finished and ready to "save" the changes, follow the instructions immediately in the `Commit changes` section below.

---

### Adding New Pages
**Please note:** If you are adding new pages to the Documentation, in addition to creating the new page, you'll need to edit the `mkdocs.yml` (YAML) file at the root (base) of the ISLE-Documentation project directory in order for the page to show up in the documentation after adding the new page.

The example used below is how to create a new documentation page that will be about building giant ISLE robots with the title of "Building Giant ISLE Robots" and be located in the Development section.

* Click into the `docs/contributor-docs` directory

* On the right hand side of the page, a navigation bar that will display `Create new file | Upload files | Find File History`, click the `Create new file` button.

* In the empty `Name your file...` field at the top of the page, enter `building_giant_robots.md`

* Enter the appropriate content to the page.

* When finished and ready to "save" the changes, follow the instructions immediately in the `Commit changes` section below.

#### Updating `mkdocs`

If you have added a new page to the Documentation, you'll need to edit the `mkdocs.yml` (YAML) file at the root (base) of the ISLE-Documentation project directory in order for the page to show up in the documentation.

* Click into the `mkdocs.yml` file.

* Once the file has been selected, you should see on the right hand side of the page, a navigation bar that will display `Raw | Blame | History`, computer monitor icon, a pen / pencil icon and a trashcan icon. Click the pen / pencil icon to edit the file.

* The page should change indicating that it can now be edited.

* Make the appropriate edits as needed.

In order for `mkdocs` to understand that there is a new page and page title to display in the rendered documentation, one must use the YAML code convention (syntax) to enter.

**YAML Code Convention Breakdown:**

- 'Page Title': '/section/filename.md'

* Within the `Contributor Docs` section of the open `mkdocs.yml` file, add this new line in the appropriate order.

`- 'Building Giant ISLE Robots': 'contributor-docs/building_giant_robots.md'`

```
- 'Contributor Docs':
  - 'Building Giant ISLE Robots': 'contributor-docs/building_giant_robots.md'
  - 'Contributing to Project': 'contributor-docs/contributing_to_project.md'
  - 'Documentation Overview': 'contributor-docs/overview.md'
```

* When finished and ready to "save" the changes, follow the instructions immediately in the `Commit changes` section below.

---

### Commit Changes

* When finished editing, adding or updating, scroll down to the `Commit changes` section.
  * In the first empty field, enter a short description of the file edited e.g. `Update glossary.md`

  * In the second larger empty field, enter a larger description of the edits
  made to the file. Two to five sentences should suffice.

  * Once finished, select the second radio button at the bottom
     * Its label displays: `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`
     * Change the branch name as needed or leave as the default.
     * Click the green `Propose File Change`

**DO NOT** SELECT THE 1ST RADIO BUTTON - `Commit directly to the master branch` as this will cause issues though it is selected by default.

### Create Pull Request for Review

The "Open a pull request" page should now appear along with text like `The change you just made was written to a new branch named githubusername-docs-fix2. Create a pull request below to propose these changes.`

* The first and second text fields may contain part of the short description. Either keep the default text or change accordingly.
* Click the green `Create pull request` button.

This pull request should now appear in the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE-Documentation/pulls) section of the ISLE repository, ready for review, commentary or inclusion by the ISLE Committers.
